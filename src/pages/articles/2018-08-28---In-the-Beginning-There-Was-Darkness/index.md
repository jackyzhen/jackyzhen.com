Hey there, welcome to this tiny little corner of the world wide netscape I call my website.

This is your typical first post of the typical personal blog of a typical software developer.
Why am I doing this blogging thing? That's a very boring and typical question to ask myself.

## The Why, in Bullet Points

- I want to be better at communicating via written form. I communicate a lot with code, not a lot with words.
- I want to write more. I haven't written anything meaningful since university.
- I'm always learning new tech. A good way to learn is to try to teach. A great way to learn is to try to teach by writing for a hypothetical audience.
- Everybody and their mothers are doing it. Like with Bitcoin, I fear missing out.

*Google image says this is a statue of Plato in thought. I like to think he is facepalming at the sight of yet another blog by yet another software guy.*

Why do they call them bullet points? What did they call them before guns were invented? Arrow dents?

## The What, in Arrow Dents

In the future you can expect from this blog:

- Tech stuff. Yeah, that's super vague.
- Cringe worthy amounts of sarcasm and bad comedy.
- Uninformed thoughts and opinions.
- ~~Stolen~~ Referenced and recommended material.
