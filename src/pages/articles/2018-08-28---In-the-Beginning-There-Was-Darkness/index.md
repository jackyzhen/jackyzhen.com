Hey there, welcome to this tiny little corner of the world wide netscape I call my website.

This is your typical first post of the typical personal blog of a typical software developer.
Why am I doing this blogging thing? Thats a very boring and typical question to ask myself.

## The Why, in Bullet Points

- I want to be better at communicating via written form. I communicate a lot with code, not a lot with words.
- I want to write more. I haven't written anything meaningful since university.
- I'm always learning new tech. A good way to learn is to try to teach. A great way to learn is to try to teach by writing for a hypothetical audience.
- Everybody else is doing it. Like with bitcoin, I fear missing out.

*Google image says this is a statue of Plato in thought. I like to think he is facepalming at the sight of yet another blog by another software guy.*

Why do they call them bullet points? What did they call them before guns were invented? Arrow dents?

Are you still reading? Why?

## The What, in Arrow Dents

In the future you can expect from this blog:

- Tech stuff. Yeah, thats super vague.
- Satire and bad comedy.
- Uninformed thoughts and onions.
- ~~Stolen~~ Referenced and reccomended material.
