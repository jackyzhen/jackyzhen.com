After more than a year of regular blog updates, I have decided to do this less regularly. The internet is probably quite tired of hearing me ramble so much every week, I am burnt out from writing so much. So you'll be hearing a lot less frequently from me on here from now on. Don't miss me too much!

Oh one last quick update: I got married. Made a fun [little website for the invitation too](https://github.com/jackyzhen/wedding) which I've just made a public repo.

It's nice to strip away most modern day frameworks and play with static sites and vanilla JS, just to remember what it was like. The modern DOM API is actually pretty good, albeit a little verbose compared to good ol jQuery.

Shout out to my top blog fan and Patreon subscriber [Tom](https://github.com/tomarrell). He's realy sad about this hiatus, but I promise to update this thing again if I have something really interesting to share.
