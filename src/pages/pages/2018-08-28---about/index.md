>>*This is not me. This is an ocelot kitten.*


I'm a software developer by trade, and I currently build neat things at [Movio](https://movio.co/). I live and work in beautiful [Auckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).

As a student, I was really into the [academic](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/z/Zhen:Jacky_Shunjie) [side](https://dblp1.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/z/Zhen:Shunjie_=Jacky=) of computer science. I even spent a year doing a [master's thesis](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/gameai/dissertations/Zhen_MSc_14.pdf). During this time I had the priviledge of travelling to St Petersburg to [represent NZ](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1303/S00933/team-infinitytek-victors-of-the-2013-microsoft-imagine-cup.htm) at the [Microsoft Imagine cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsnr0FjjxUI). But student loan debts caught up with me and I eventually had to get [real jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacky-shunjie-zhen-5b735042). I've primarily been a [full-stack](http://i.imgur.com/lS43VnN.png) developer, since I enjoy working with both [frontend and backend](https://i.redd.it/ku1neu504sh01.jpg).

A while back, I played a lot of PC games and did [pretty well](https://i.imgur.com/S5Pvd48.jpg) at [some of them](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/69866074). But recently, I've become interested being good at [public speaking](https://www.facebook.com/MtAlbertToastmasters), and [getting more involved](https://www.meetup.com/Go-AKL/events/lgxqcpyxlbcc/) in [tech communities](https://www.meetup.com/rust-akl/). I also enjoy *starting* a lot of useless projects on [github](https://github.com/jackyzhen). Emphasis on starting.

Even further back I was really into watching [kickboxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Rgk0xOThg) and getting [beaten up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZEKFufvQA). Nowadays, I struggle to do enough exercise. I really should exercise more.
